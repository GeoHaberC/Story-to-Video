In a cozy cafe, a delicious cup of boba tea sits on a vibrant red table.
A charming white cat gazes at Baby Yoda through the window with curiosity.
The adorable white cat grins as Baby Yoda and cries out for assistance, clutching at a bottle of milk tightly in his tiny hand.
A caring teacher rushes to the rescue, but arrives a moment too late to offer the boba tea to Baby Yoda.
The boba tea spills onto the floor, causing the white cat to shriek in surprise. The teacher is startled by the commotion, while Baby Yoda bursts into laughter at the unfolding scene.
The end.
